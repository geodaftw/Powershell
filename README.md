# Powershell
Helpful powershell scripts

## AD-Enumeration
A script that's been helpful in quickly identifying user, computer and AD group information

## loginQuery
A script that utilizes "reg query" to remotely check if/who is logged into a remote computer

## checkIfReset
A script that checks if a list of users have reset their password from a specific date
This is helpful if you send out a password reset email on Jan 1 and you tell them they have until Jan 7. You can check on Jan 7 to see who from the list HAS and HAS NOT reset their password
This script can be modified to perform other actions too
